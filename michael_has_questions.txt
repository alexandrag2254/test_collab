1) Who are golfingirl54 and Cannula? I'm assuming alter egos of Alexandra and Nathan?
        (alexandra): yes, you are able to set your username for each repo you contribute to. In the same step you are able to set a contact email.
2) Who is in charge of merging develop branch into master branch? Or are we just working in develop?
        (alexandra): probably me since I created the repo, but technically anyone of us can do it given that no permissions have been set.
3) Should we play around with access permissions? At the moment all three of us can push directly to the remote repo and I'm assuming we can all merge changes into the master branch. 
        (alexandra): yes I can do this. maybe we can first create a few more branches and then set permissions. 
4) From reading there are only two permission levels: the repository owners (which we all are currently) and collaborators which doesn't sound ideal to me. I might trust Nathan to push directly to remote repo but not want him to be able to merge changes into the master branch ;) I suppose the owners agree amongst themselves what the procedures will be and in any case changes to master branch can be rolled back
	(alexandra): this is a user created repository so I am the repository owner in this case and I've added michael and nathan as collaborators. Since I have not set any permission restrictions both of you are able to do everything I am able to do EXCEPT: delete repo, merge a pull request on a protected branch, change visibility of repo and invite other collaborators
