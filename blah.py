  ##  This program's expected output is "My name is Nathan", but replace Nathan with whatever the person's name is.
  ##  Unfortunately, the output is "My name is what".
  ##  This is a pretty minimal, shoddy program.
  ##  Is this a 'fatal' error, or a 'logic' error?
  ##  What's broken here?

name = 'Alex'
print ('My name is as follows: ' + name)
