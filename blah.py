  ##  This program's expected output is "My name is Nathan", but replace Nathan with whatever the person's name is.
  ##  Unfortunately, the output is "My name is what".
  ##  This is a pretty minimal, shoddy program.
  ##  Is this a 'fatal' error, or a 'logic' error?
  ##  What's broken here?

name = 'what'

print ('My name is ' + name)

  ##  Here's where I'd put my name:
name = 'Nathan'

  ##  Hint: fixable by reordering some lines.
